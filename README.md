## Software Quality Assurance (QA) Developer Intern at Shanghai ByteDance Technology Co., Ltd. -- 3/2019-8/2019
From the begin of March to the end of Augest In 2019, I was very honor to work as a Automated Software Quality Assurance Developer intern at Shanghai Bytedance Company (which is famous for launching the [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/) and [Douyin](https://www.douyin.com/) APP which has 3.2 billion users in China). In these more than 6 months, I devoted myself into the center-platform tesing team with the agile development enviornment. I had worked with website quality control on  front-end and back-end, also tested the quality on mobile end. Further due to the large scale of data, we mostly designed and built coresponding continuous platform for automated testing by **Jenkins** in **JAVA** or python scripts. The original code for the outstanding projects can be found at [here](https://github.com/GuangYang98/e-Portfolio).

Expertly utilized tools to track bugs, I implemented and achieved 16 times accelerate automated test evaluation on 1,400,000 data by using **multi-process in Python and MySQL**. I also used **Bash script** to facilitate my development. Various algorithms were tested by me in OCR text recognition, image recognition and data mining, reduced 5 times manpower in 3 systems. I had experience working with business and development team to prioritize assignments and manage risks/issues to ensure successful delivery with high quality. Finally, I successfully launched 6 public web services in total.

During the memorable time working in Bytedance, I had got such a lot friends and the charishable approbate from the team leader Zhi Li and the mentor Min Geng, Fig 1 and Fig 2 are the pictures when I was coming to the US, they prepared the surprise for me and wrote the best wishes for me from every person I had collaborated with.

## 4 months' Research Intern at EMC Lab, Missouri University of Science and Technology, MO
During the 2018 Summer, I got an opportunity to be a research intern at EMC Lab in MST. EMC lab in MST is leading **the worldâ€™s leading technology, Emission Source Microscopy** and every graduates from EMC can get the work in the top company, like Apple, google, amazon, facebook, intel etc.

I led the research of , under supervision of Prof. Victor Khilkevich(shon in figure 6) My research work mainly focus on applying the computer vision method for 3D map and trajectories reconstruction, the figure 7 and 8 are shown for the setup and experiment scheme. 

I designed SLAM algorithms to realize real-time positioning by using Kinect V2, and achieve 0.2 cm accuracy. A MATLAB program also wrote by me for robust UDP transmission with Vector Network Analyzer. I implemented real-time source plane estimation with friendly GUI. I also promoted the development of circuit board surface current measurement technology during the internship.

## Two patterns with a publication for indoor localization research
### Won first publication and National 1st Prize in Undergraduate Innovation Training Program
Junhong Lin, Bang Wang, **Guang Yang** and Mu Zhou. **Indoor Localization Based on Weighted Surfacing from Crowdsourced Samples [J].** _Sensors_ 2018, 18(9), 2990.SCIE. [The link of the paper](http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/9/2990)  

In this program, I conducted research concerning high-precision indoor positioning system based on reliable sample selection and surface fitting. I used MATLAB to write programs for data processing and experiment simulation.

Later, I developed an indoor high-precision indoor positioning system and published an article on _Sensors_.

## Project of HUIYAN Classroom Intelligent Monitor System

I led a project called HUIYAN Classroom Intelligent Monitor System, which monitored the ongoing class of K12 and intelligently analyzed the collected information, for the sake of making suggestions for teachers. First of all, I collected massive video data of teaching in real classroom and established multi-behavior dataset. Taking advantage of the massive dataset, I designed **convolution neural network** in Caffe framework for behavior detection, and achieved **92.8% system accuracy**.

## Project of [PIPILONG Music](https://www.mamasousuo.com/homepage/#/)
Aim to educate children on playing the piano, we developed an easy-to-use application on the iOS system. In this project, we made use of the microphone and employed signal processing technique to analyze spectrum to guide the children to play piano. I Implemented application on iOS by using **Swift** with beautiful and friendly GUI. Our APP can display the real-time progress of the practice and the children can be aware of where they make mistakes during the practice. The APP is uploaded to Apple store.

## Startup Team of [Mental Pressure Manager](https://www.cyzone.cn/company/346748.html)
Mental Pressure Manager is a biotechnology-based medical hardware device targeted to detect the psychological pressure by cortisol through the strip test.

I collaborated with teammates with biomedical background and served as a Product Manager, in charge of designing the structure of the product. Our product aimed to detect the psychological pressure by an automated strip test of cortisol, based on Internet of Things and mobile health techniques. I communicated with investment institutions about the startup projects and started up the Huace Kangnuo (Wuhan) Biotechnology Inc. for the product. The project has been completed, and this opportunity to incorporate technologies of different fields still widened my horizon.

## Artificial Intelligence & Software Course Project
To relieve the great pressure at instructors' office hours, I developed an AI teaching platform to help students in Q&A. I constructed the database with Python and wrote algorithms with machine learning. Students now can talk to the AI robot on Wechat to solve their academic questions at spare time.

## Communication system implementation on ADALM-PLUTO SDR ([Link](https://guangyang1143252657.github.io/PlutoSDR/))
ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radio is a portable self-contained RF learning module. I developed a communication system with the Pluto SDR and utilized Matlab to write programs and algorithms to realize simple protocols. This fruitful experience develop my skill in Matlab programming and the understanding of Radio Frequency communication.
