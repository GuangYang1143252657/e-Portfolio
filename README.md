# e-Portfolio of Guang Yang

Hello! Here are some examples of my previous work.

## Research Intern at Electromagnetic Compatibility Lab, Missouri University of Science and Technology
During the last summer, I was a research intern at EMC Lab in MST. I delved into Emission Source Microscopy (ESM) by referring to previous publication under supervision of Prof. Victor Khilkevich. My research work mainly focus on applying the computer vision method for 3D map and trajectories reconstruction.

I am responsible for writing MATLAB programs for robust data transmission and design algorithms to realize real-time positioning of wireless probes by using Kinect V2. I implemented real-time source plane estimation with friendly GUI (as shown in Fig. 5)

By the way, I also promoted the development of circuit board surface current measurement technology during the internship.

## The first publication and National 1st Prize in Undergraduate Innovation Training Program
In the program, I conducted research concerning high-precision indoor positioning system based on reliable sample selection and surface fitting. I used MATLAB to write programs for data processing and experiment simulation.

Later, I developed an indoor high-precision indoor positioning system and published an article on _Sensors_.
