# e-Portfolio of Guang Yang

Hello! Here are some examples of my previous work.

## Research Intern at Electromagnetic Compatibility Lab, Missouri University of Science and Technology
During the last summer, I was a research intern at EMC Lab in MST. I delved into Emission Source Microscopy (ESM) by referring to previous publication under supervision of Prof. Victor Khilkevich. My research work mainly focus on applying the computer vision method for 3D map and trajectories reconstruction.

I am responsible for writing MATLAB programs for robust data transmission and design algorithms to realize real-time positioning of wireless probes by using Kinect V2. I implemented real-time source plane estimation with friendly GUI (as shown in Fig. 5)

By the way, I also promoted the development of circuit board surface current measurement technology during the internship.

## The first publication and National 1st Prize in Undergraduate Innovation Training Program
Junhong Lin, Bang Wang, **Guang Yang** and Mu Zhou. **Indoor Localization Based on Weighted Surfacing from Crowdsourced Samples [J].** _Sensors_ 2018, 18(9), 2990.SCIE. [The link of the paper](http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/9/2990)  

In this program, I conducted research concerning high-precision indoor positioning system based on reliable sample selection and surface fitting. I used MATLAB to write programs for data processing and experiment simulation.

Later, I developed an indoor high-precision indoor positioning system and published an article on _Sensors_.

## Research Project of [PIPILONG Music](https://www.mamasousuo.com/homepage/#/)
Aim to educate children on playing the piano, we developed an easy-to-use application on the iOS system. In this project, we made use of the microphone and employed signal processing technique to analyze spectrum to guide the children to play piano. Our APP can display the real-time progress of the practice and the children can be aware of where they make mistakes during the practice. The APP is uploaded to Apple store.

## Startup Team of [Mental Pressure Manager](https://www.cyzone.cn/company/346748.html)
Mental Pressure Manager is a biotechnology-based medical hardware device targeted to detect the psychological pressure by cortisol through the strip test.

I collaborated with teammates with biomedical background and served as a Product Manager, in charge of designing the structure of the product. Our product aimed to detect the psychological pressure by an automated strip test of cortisol, based on Internet of Things and mobile health techniques. I communicated with investment institutions about the startup projects and started up the Huace Kangnuo (Wuhan) Biotechnology Inc. for the product. The project has been completed, and this opportunity to incorporate technologies of different fields still widened my horizon.

## Artificial Intelligence & Software Course Project
To relieve the great pressure at instructors' office hours, I developed an AI teaching platform to help students in Q&A. I constructed the database with Python and wrote algorithms with machine learning. Students now can talk to the AI robot on Wechat to solve their academic questions at spare time.

## Communication system implementation on ADALM-PLUTO SDR ([Link](https://guangyang1143252657.github.io/PlutoSDR/))
ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radio is a portable self-contained RF learning module. I developed a communication system with the Pluto SDR and utilized Matlab to write programs and algorithms to realize simple protocols. This fruitful experience develop my skill in Matlab programming and the understanding of Radio Frequency communication.
